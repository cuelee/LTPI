# LTPI
- Liability Threshold Phenotipic Integration

`LTPI` is a command line tool to derive new phenotypes for a target disease by combining genetic relatedness information with phenotypic information.

## Getting Started

In order to download `LTPI`, you should clone this repository via the command
```
git clone https://github.com/cuelee/LTPI.git
cd LTPI
```

In order to run `LTPI`, the following python dependencies must be installed in your system.

- python
- pandas
- numpy
- numba
- scipy
- sklearn


Once the above has completed, you can run the following command:

```
./LTPI.py -h
```

## Updating LTPI
You can update to the newest version of `LTPI` using git. First, navigate to your LTPI/ directory (e.g., cd LTPI), then run
```
git pull
```
If `LTPI` is up to date, you will see
```
Already up-to-date.
```
